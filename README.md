## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Originally, I was going to make the progress bar a mishmash of components as opposed to a range, but after going through w3schools looking for more condensed work, I tried this version out. I think it worked well, although I still have absolutely no idea how to employ the gradient and that's why it's Sort Of Incomplete because of this. Would love to look for feedback!

I also just struggled with this in general - especially the total usage speech bubble and the layout due to the overlapping layers and how I used flexbox. But I fought through and I like my result, although I am STILL struggling with getting everything centered. I try every method under the sun and none of them seem to work.

### Continued development

Practice using range and see if there's other projects to work it into.
